Flutterwave has given developers in Africa and the rest of the world, a choice to go beyond the limits set by some payment engine providers. Now you have a world class solution to collect money from those who want to pay. Forget that one that says you can give but cannot receive. *Dia Fada!!!* :wave::v:
Just add this to your react project and customize as desired. 

## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-flutterwave-button
```

## Usage

```tsx
const App = ( ) => (
